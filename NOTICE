Third Party Software Attributions, Copyrights, Licenses and Disclosure
Pengjie Liang (Jayden Liang) <jaydenliang81@gmail.com> June 2018

Certain open source or other third-party software components and/or 
libraries are directly integrated with the Encors software. Such 
third-party components and/or libraries include their own terms and
conditions, such as attribution and liability disclaimers 
(collectively "Third Party Disclosures",) for which disclosure is 
required by their respective owners. This document sets forth such 
Third Party Disclosures for the Encors software as of the date set 
forth above.

The owner of Encors software respectfully acknowledges that other 
third-party software components and/or libraries are also indirectly
integrated with the Encors software by the direct use of certain 
third-party software components and/or libraries. The owner of Encors 
software admits their attributions, copyrights, licenses, and 
desclosures but is unable to copy such Third Party Disclosures into 
this document.
